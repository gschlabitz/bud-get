An automated budget the way I like it.

## Just use a Spreadsheet!

I've used many banking and budget apps over the years and they always
disappointed. Sure, they had fancy features and graphs, but were hard to use,
importing transactions only worked sometimes, and one or two things important to
me were just missing. Some of them sold my data, others were just an ad vehicle
for banks.

Years later, I discovered that I don't need to rely on a banking app. The best
way and cheapest way to do budgets is a spreadsheet. It is such a simple and
flexible concept! You can make your budget exactly the way you like it.

## Drawbacks of Spreadsheets

The only drawback is the data entry aspect. I'm lazy and wanted to find a way to
automate this and here is were Bud-Get comes in!

## Such Automation

Download all your transactions, e.g. checking account, credit card, PayPal,
etc., as .CSV files into the inputs folder. Running Bud-Get will grab your
exported CSV and:

- categorize each transaction they way you like it
- format them into an income/expense table for each month
- generate a year-to-date overview
- add a pre-filled budget template based on your categories and downloaded data
- NOT send data anywhere for monetization, woohoo!
